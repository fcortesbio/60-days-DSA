# 60 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my 60-day journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms! 🚀

This repository documents my daily learning following the comprehensive roadmap by [Neha Gupta](https://medium.com/@nehaguptacareercoach), where I tackle one DSA concept per day with detailed notes and implementations in three programming languages.

## 📚 Learning Structure

Each day follows a consistent structure:

```
XX-topic_name/
├── notes.md           # Concept explanation, examples, and solutions
├── solution.py        # Python implementation
├── solution.js        # Node.js/JavaScript implementation  
└── solution.java      # Java implementation
```

## 🎯 Goals

- **Master fundamental DSA concepts** through daily practice
- **Multi-language proficiency** - implement each concept in Python, JavaScript, and Java
- **Problem-solving patterns** - learn to recognize and apply common techniques
- **Interview preparation** - build confidence for technical interviews

## 📋 Progress Tracker

## 📖 Key Learning Areas

This 60-day journey covers:

- **Arrays & Subarrays** - Prefix sums, sliding window, two pointers
- **Strings** - Pattern matching, manipulation techniques
- **Linked Lists** - Traversal, manipulation, cycle detection
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO/FIFO operations, monotonic structures
- **Trees & Binary Trees** - Traversals, BST operations, tree construction
- **Graphs** - DFS/BFS, shortest paths, topological sorting
- **Dynamic Programming** - Memoization, tabulation, optimization patterns
- **Sorting & Searching** - Various algorithms and their applications
- **Hash Tables** - Efficient lookups, collision handling
- **Advanced Topics** - Greedy algorithms, backtracking, bit manipulation

## 🎯 Daily Routine

1. **Read and understand** the concept from notes.md
2. **Trace through examples** manually
3. **Implement solutions** in all three languages
4. **Test with different inputs** 
5. **Analyze time/space complexity**
6. **Reflect on patterns** and key takeaways

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning journey, but feel free to:
- Suggest optimizations to existing solutions
- Point out edge cases I might have missed
- Share alternative approaches or cleaner implementations

## 📝 Reflection Notes

### Day 1 Achievements 🎆
**Subarray Sums & Range Queries** turned into an comprehensive performance analysis masterclass:

✨ **Algorithm Implementations:**
- **7 different approaches** from O(n³) brute force to O(n) contribution techniques
- **Multi-paradigm solutions:** Pure Python, vectorized Python, and NumPy implementations
- **Professional benchmarking suite** with statistical analysis and insights

🔬 **Key Discoveries:**
- **Modern Python JIT compilation** makes simple loops incredibly fast for small data
- **NumPy crossover point** occurs around n=1,000 elements
- **Algorithmic complexity** isn't everything - constant factors and overhead matter significantly
- **"Clever" optimizations** often don't provide expected benefits for small problem sizes

🎯 **Performance Engineering:**
- Empirical validation of performance hypotheses
- Scale-dependent optimization strategy analysis  
- Real-world measurement of theoretical complexity claims
- Professional-grade benchmarking and statistical reporting

This deep dive demonstrated that **learning DSA isn't just about implementing algorithms** - it's about understanding their **real-world behavior and trade-offs**!

I'll be updating this section with key insights and patterns I discover throughout the journey.

**Started:** October 2025  
**Target Completion:** December 2025
**Commitment:** One concept per day, no exceptions! 💪
